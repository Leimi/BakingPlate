# Baking Plate version v0.1.0

BakingPlate is a cake plugin that assists in generating/baking CakePHP projects
(by which we mean apps that use a core install of cake - see Advanced Installion of Cake) 

It contains a ***skel****leton directory* from which the derived app is created.
The **skel** comes pre-set with a great deal of *hotness baked in*.  The skel is tweaked for advanced setup.
