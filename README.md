# Baking Plate version v0.1.0

BakingPlate is a cake plugin that assists in generating/baking CakePHP projects
(by which we mean apps that use a core install of cake - see Advanced Installion of Cake) 

It contains a ***skel****leton directory* from which the derived app is created.
The **skel** comes pre-set with a great deal of *hotness baked in*.  The skel is tweaked for advanced setup.

The intention is to boost start projects giving the application additional functionality of
many popular cake plugins and vendor code that are used frequently in cakephp 1.3.* apps.

BakingPlate intends to build upon CakePHP's convention rather than configuration policy.

Some Benefits of Using BakingPlate (some features may vary depending on release - more details in to listed below. Check the open issues too)

* Since BakingPlate creates project apps upgrading cake is easier (1 cake install not many).
* Its a vanilla cake - if your familiar with cake the projects created by BakingPlate will not be new to you.
  (with some cake projects you have to learn a whole new set of conventions onto of cake);
  you can add bespoke features to your app.
* Advanced & Management of Caching.
* Preset Code to work with FCKEditor, TinyMCE or indeed Markdown.
* Lazy Model Loading.
* Maintenace mode that lets Auth Users login and browse whilst non auth users see maintenace layout.
* A Html5 Boilerplate Theme (adhering to all the best practices that apply to cakeapps).
* User Login/Registration/Management System (ACL One day also) using CakeDC Users &amp; ProLoser Welcome plugins.
* Planned intergration with ProLoser's Cart Plugin.
* Planned Mobile Detection &amp; Theme Switching (that will support view caching) using subdomains (moving to a revised version of plateplus).
