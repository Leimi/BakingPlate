This is a project baked by cake and employs the advised best practices of Html5 Boilerplate it aims to use some truly cool cake plugins and some vendor scipts to automagically make some nice structural substance and pre-equip the resulting instance with a whole lot of nice ness baked in.

We aim to ahere to every tier of the cake during the baking process so that much so that the result is a splendid ready to decorate blank canvas app.

The baked project will have some awesome tasks and comandline joy that you can utilize to ease the management of the resulting app.

The resulting app will make use of tools that will work in conjuction with git (many or all of you will be using git already and you all enjoy the command line) to control and individualize the app your creating.

The aim is to provide additional functionality without imposing tedious setup. Also the intention is remain vanilla in the sense that you add the flavour and bakingplate unifies the wonders of cake with html5boierplate in to the stucture. This should be able to produce a boosted jump start to your freshly baked html5 cake, it should not impose to much Html5 Boilerplate gives you the perfect blank canvas, this project bakes the canvas to your specifications. The generated Controllers, models and views are html5ified.

These are some inital thoughts and I need to read more from the likes of David Perrson, Jose Gonzalez, Andy Dawson.

The inspiration for this project was CakePlate and the initial html5 boilerplate project and recent plugins made by the CakeDC Team.
