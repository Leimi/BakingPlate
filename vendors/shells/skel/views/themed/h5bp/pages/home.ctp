        <p>This is a project baked by cake and employs the advised best practices
        of Html5 Boilerplate it aims to use some truly cool cake plugins and some
        vendor scipts to automagically make some nice structural substance and
        pre-equip the resulting instance with a whole lot of nice ness baked in.</p>
        <p>We aim to ahere to every tier of the cake during the baking process
        so that much so that the result is a splendid ready to decorate blank canvas app.</p>
        <p>The baked project will have some awesome tasks and comandline joy
        that you can utilize to ease the management of the resulting app.</p>
        <p>The resulting app will make use of tools that will work in conjuction
        with git (many or all of you will be using git already and you all enjoy
        the command line) to control and individualize the app your creating.</p>
        <p>The aim is to provide additional functionality without imposing tedious setup.
        Also the intention is remain vanilla in the sense that you add the flavour
        and bakingplate unifies the wonders of cake with html5boierplate in to
        the stucture.  This should be able to produce a boosted jump start to your
        freshly baked html5 cake, it should not impose to much Html5 Boilerplate
        gives you the perfect blank canvas, this project bakes the canvas to your
        specifications.  The generated Controllers,&nbsp;models and views are html5ified.</p>
        <p>These are some inital thoughts and I need to read more from the likes
        of David Perrson, Jose Gonzalez, Andy Dawson.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for this project was CakePlate and the initial
        html5 boilerplate project and recent plugins made by the CakeDC Team.</p>
